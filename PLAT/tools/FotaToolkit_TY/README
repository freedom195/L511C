INTRODUCTION

FotaToolkit is a small toolkit for FOTA service. Actually, it is always used to make a delta binary file deriving from two different binary images
and to merge two delta files(*.par) into an entire parchive(*.par). 
Furthermore, it provides a way to download/deliver data to a specific memory zone for upgrading the system device or updating the system data
via AT command and a way to read the data from a specific memory zone as well,
